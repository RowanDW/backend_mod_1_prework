## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

_There is already a good bit of this that I already do. I read/listen to audio books
a lot, although a much of it is fiction. I think I will to to switch some of that to
non-fiction and tech articles. I think I am also beginning to have a grasp on the
importance of numbers 2 and 3, viewing learning as a process and having a growth
mindset. I have been actively working on shifting my thought patterns to be more growth
focused._

_I definitely think there are ways I can improve my learning. I would love to try explaining what I am learning to my partner (hopefully I won't be too annoying haha). I just installed a pomodoro timer chrome extension so I can practice taking frequent breaks. I think that the most difficult part of adopting these six habits is definitely going to be adjusting my diet to keep my brain healthy. I don't eat super well at the moment._

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

_An integer is a whole number, while a float is a number with a decimal place._
1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`p animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

_Interpolation is when you substitute the results of code into a string._

`p "My favorite animal is a #{animal}."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

`gets.chomp`

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

`.length` _- This returns the number of characters in the string_

`.split` _- This breaks the string into parts based on spaces. It returns an Array of the new strings. You can also split it on a different character, which you do by passing in arguments, like this:_
`.split(",")`
